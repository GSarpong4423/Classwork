var arnellTedTalk = "hi everybody welcome to google talks today is a very special day I want to introduce a great friend of mine somebody that I really look up to in a text base his name is Arne L Milhouse what makes him unique and very special is he has led many hackathons in Rhode Island has been recognized by President Obama and Congress many women aside from that the beautiful thing is that he's helped today lead many underprivileged and underserved markets for people that are interested in becoming engineers aside from that he is constantly challenging the status quo and always making sure that many people are involved and challenged every day in a very technological digital age I love to welcome my dearest friend and a leader in tech and a serial entrepreneur are now Milhouse of course thank you mom appreciate it thanks for having me it's been great to be here all right so good afternoon everyone again my name is Arne L Milhouse and it's an interesting story and an interesting interesting journey that we're embarking upon and today we're gonna be talking about rebooting emerging domestic markets this concept was first spoken about three or four decades ago by a Harvard University professor who talked about taking urban centers and the taking the underserved workers in those communities training them giving them the right technical skills or labor skills that they needed to integrate into society here in America wrote a really great book about it but the concept never really took off and throughout my life as I grew up in the story that room about to share I always thought about how can we really make this happen how can we take it from the page and put it on the stage as they often say in Broadway right from the page to the stage and I'm even writing a book about it rebooting emerging domestic markets we are connecting the middle class innovation process in America and I'm an entrepreneur a software developer but I really think of myself as a social change agent someone who's trying to bring about change and impact Steve Jobs talked about of all the things that he wanted to do in his life he simply wanted to make a dent in the universe and it wasn't about the money it wasn't about the creations or the accolades it was about making a significant change and so I created a company called intra-city geeks along with a couple other gentlemen I'll be introducing them by name and another organization called career devs interested in gigs our goal is to simply fuel computer science education in to drive innovation driven entrepreneurship throughout American cities in both underserved and under skilled market our main goal is to impact one million-plus people in our pipeline the other organization is called career devs and career does is launching rigorous computer science academies along with innovation driven entrepreneurial incubators so while intercity geeks is the nonprofit armed career Deb's is the for-profit arm how all this stuff comes together you really need to take a deep dive into my story and it's a really interesting story I believe it starts off back in Boston Massachusetts where I was born I was born to a single mother Dorothy Lee Milhouse and single mom which is really the prototypical urban story that you hear for people of color right and my mother had four children which one is me can you guys guess that's me right there second oldest and what was interesting in Boston that we went from a middle-class neighborhood my mother end up getting sick we move from the middle-class neighborhood to a lower income neighborhood actually after she took ill and while Roxbury which was the neighbor that we moved to was very very tough there was gunfire drug needles I've had guns held to my head coming from school people robbed me from money I would get home my mother like oh how was your day honey my goal was fine so a couple of things we're interesting one we didn't know that we were poor and we didn't know that I didn't know that we should be unhappy we were happy we had a nice family and but one day my mother when we were on welfare food stamps section 8 housing she took our housing certificate to the housing authorities and said she wanted to move and they were asking her where do you want to move and she mentioned that she wanted to move to Cape Cod right and it wasn't until we actually moved to Cape Cod that I noticed this that the urban lifestyle formula we had been living but there was a vicious perpetuating cycle that repeated itself so when eighth grade we packed up we moved to Cape Cod and it was you know people this is the place that people travel to for vacations right from all around the world and I'm living there 365 days a year but I notice another cycle a virtuous perpetuating cycle which was the opposite of what was taking place in Boston and for the first time in my life something changed my worldview because living in Boston and Cape Cod the dichotomy was incredibly different on the Cape I was taking courses such as Latin where I learned one of my favorite jokes ubi sunt Cebu be where are your underwear we even had a you know a rap for Latin Latin is a dead language it's dead as it can be first it killed the Romans and now it's killing me right but magna celery taught a cool ascent to jiggly and so I'm learning all these different things and when we move to the Cape we didn't live in tenement buildings that you found in the city we lived right off the set and told of the dentist Pines Golf Course and I remember waking up one morning I saw these little white balls in my yard I said mom why these balls keep coming into our yard and one of those people out there doing what are they why are they are they farming it looks like they're trying to farm what are they what are they planting I couldn't understand it see no honey they're playing golf I said what is golf and I learned about Camelot the Kennedys they live ten minutes from me the Kennedy compound John F Kennedy is family everyone all right they're their lineage so I heard the story I was regaled with all the tales of their fame in their wealth and it was just a different perspective of learning about a former president but their family lives down the street this is the next stage was kind of interesting my first job in high school took place in a place called Fred's turkey house now this was really impactful because while I was I sawed off as a dishwasher than a prep cook than a lion cooked been a chef but at this restaurant the person that owned his name was Fred bloom one of my greatest mentors and influencers in my life he had about four or five restaurants on the Cape and there's a gentleman that went to Harvey University that graduated in computer science who worked from running all of the communications chef's rule he was talking about trying to lure me to the dark side which was computer science because are now because you don't want to be a laborer sweating away in a kitchen all your life he goes listen you know you love playing around computers and making these video games in school stick with that and so I said ah but then Fred said hey listen go to Johnson well University come back here and manage my restaurant so there was a light side and the dark side tempting me then in high school I took my first computer programming class Pascal fell in love myself and several of the students we were always getting in trouble doing things with code that you shouldn't be doing and then I got a job working for my high school making $12 an hour as a junior I was hooked I was making more than I was in the restaurant business and it was just phenomenal something else interesting that that happened on a cake was one of my teachers was asking where I lived in Boston I said oh I remember living what we once lived on Mass Ave Massachusetts Avenue she said oh you were right down the street from MIT I said am i what am i who she cos no MIT Ivy League university never heard of it she was less than a quarter mile for me and that really bothered me that MIT and Harvard were so close but they might as well Abby they might as well have been miles away planets away different universe really going to school on the Cape students would pull up in school and BMWs Mercedes or just brand new cars brand new Toyotas when our car even though we lived on a Cape it was still a UH we were still poor we were using a housing certificate to live on Cape Cod so sometimes dropping us at the school we had this station wagon that had mich mats wheels smoke coming out of the back of it and so I would beg my mother Mike mom can you please just can you drop me off down the street because honey but it still like a quarter mile walk I'm like I was just embarrassed to pull up in the school in that car what was happening was that I was experiencing culture shock I was seriously undergoing a sense of disorientation and disbelief about what I was seeing my middle school the cafeteria was more of a medicine of what you have here in Boston we didn't have the cafeteria it was everything was makeshift and the food wasn't that great periodically we would travel back and forth to Boston and I began to see this divergence between my cousin's lives and my friends lives my friends and their parents on the Cape versus they're my friends and their parents in Boston as I was in Boston I would notice that the adults were talking about how hard things were that there were no opportunities they just lost their job they couldn't get ahead they their electricity was being turned off this week on the Cape everything was happy and everyone was doing fine and as we would go back and forth it was lights on lights off lights on life lights off and it was disconcerting and I didn't know I said in Boston and Cape Cod 60 miles apart so it really really really troubled me back and forth Cape Cod Boston Cape Cod to Boston and I remember the exact moment that this thing happened I woke up one morning I realized I had two worldviews because my friends in Boston they all in myself included when I move initially moved to Cape Cod I wanted to be a rapper basketball player or some type of athlete or entertainer where everyone on the Cape was talking about where we're going to school what we're gonna do without careers and so hearing two different worlds two different world views and I saw that one world view was just crumbling and the other was thriving so I left high school when I went to college at Johnson Wells University computer science much like my buddy cliff and at Johnson Wells things really took off I was a computer lab assistant and that's why I'm friend about I learned about innovation I started taking some of the processes that they had in place that took four or five days to change the computers over at the end of each semester and I brought it down to a three-hour process and my bosses were freaking out they're like oh my goodness it was amazing and there are a lot of other things that I did that really really impacted the university something really really bad happened though my freshman year my mother passed away all those years are being sick on housing she passed away my younger brother and younger sister my older brother might help we had to try to figure out what we're going to do my older brother said you school work hard send money home on the weekends and I did that in my sophomore year I became the senior lab assistant at Johnson Wells which I received free tuition which really saved me because the school was sending me notices that you have no money you can't you can't stay in school and I graduate Johnson Wells and something interesting happened the second job that I had was in Boston and when I was on the Cape my mother would tell me all the time pay attention are now I brought you down here so you could pay attention to find out how people are becoming successful and family up the family what does your father do oh he's into technology again it was Jeff at Fred Turkey house are now come to the dark side but every family seemed to have some connection to some type of technical organization working in Boston so after number apply to a job in Boston I applied for this data telecommunications company walked into the company another shocked I walked in and I was the only person of color within the entire organ I said they're not gonna hire my mic there's no way but I become really good at what I do with technology computer science so I got an offer letter in the mail and it was for $80,000 it was a second time but I was a shocked culture shock the company much like here at Google cafeteria food chefs coming in massage therapist I didn't know that it was leading up to this $80,000 a year $15,000 annual bonus 15,000 shares of stock what is stock stop what's what's stock is that like Campbell's stock I didn't know but I gonna say me 15,000 cans of Campbell's stock I don't want that but it was culture shock round two something else hit me I was no longer poor and it was welcome to the middle class but I think as hard as it was making it there if I had known that it was going to be that difficult I probably have given up but since I made it this far I think why stop at the middle class why not keep on going what's the next second exit have in store so something interesting started happening my friends family and neighbors started noticing oh Mario it's a new clothes new car living in a nice house so people were peeking and then people thought to knock in my door especially my friends I have a friend that was in a Marines and he came up to me says are now listen I just got into Marines all I need to do is shoot a gun what do I do I got him involved in technology in and after him his name is Jason he's african-american another friend of mine Rick Jamaican background table Cambodian Tim Irish American Dave English OC Latino Tim Kevin Derrick's am Charlie Lynn John Mike will Jeff Chuck Devin Pete Rob Couric so many other people that started coming to me and my friends to get involved in technology people who were on welfare unemployed or severely underemployed overall about 25 people who now have an aggregate annual income of over two million dollars and if you look at the majority of those people all got married all owned homes and so that cycle that my mother was caught up in and that so many other people are caught in single mother no father in the household there's now being broken in so many people's lives and so many children including myself my two amazing stones right here in my amazing life who I would not I would not be here without and so I started thinking again how do we solve the income inequality puzzle and the solution is simple we have to do it at scale and that's where I really began thinking about the rebooting emerging domestic markets so I had my great moment of Epiphany seeing it with all of my friends had attained and then over the past few years looking at all of the pains that this country has been going through with the battles between race and income and the haves and have-nots I said vibe time for my friends I simply need to do for the rest of the country that's easy right no problem so I started a company called intra-city geeks it's a non-profit and something interesting happened I put an ad up on Brown University's website and this double major at my econ Brainiac named Rapala Spanky's applied I sat down with them blew me away with his intelligence he worked with me getting an organization going and then I met another gentleman and he's here today in the audience same as cliff Brainiac you seem like the Superman comics Brainiac that's cliff right there and we'll talk a little bit more about that but intercity geeks we started teaching at the middle school level in Providence and it got picked up in the news like wow this is really cool no one's done this before or at least not at the scale that we were looking to to run our programs we were in channel 10 we're taking students to hackathons at Brown University and they were growing they were doing amazing things of themselves in the red shirt here you can see my son Mathias he actually teaches with me now he's a lead instructor for elementary school students he's 14 years old eighth grader actually not yet in a few weeks he's going to be but he's doing amazing things and again that generational stronghold a generation of change effect having a father figure a mother figure that's nurturing him to help him grow in a life is coming up behind learning as well so we went for middle schools to high schools qicang talking about how they can get jobs in technology seventy thousand seventy two thousand dollars is the average of the jobs paying in Rhode Island the mayor of Providence contacted us and said hey you're doing some great things what could we do together so we created a hackathon for the city of Providence and not just any hackathon but we were also recognized by President Obama for our work was on the White House website August 4th 2015 the culture shock is continuing to happen I'm seeing the vision fulfilled of what we're trying to do and for one of the hackathons that we did what we attempted to do we built the satellite communications array to communicate with the astronauts in the International Space Station as it flew overhead over Providence the astronauts were sleeping but we did get a ping connection signal with our device and but we've stressed to the students when we did this we partnered with a group from Brown University middle school students and high school students who assembled the communications array designed it and got it working this is the type of innovation that we want to let students know as possible and they're like now they go out there they have apps on their phones I get calls from students all done hey I'm looking at the International Space Station going over ahead I'm following them on Twitter right in there talking about engineering they're talking about Aeronautics these are types of impact and change that you want to be able to make everyone can't move to Cape Cod after that the governor of Rhode Island got in contact is contact with us through her innovation Department and we created a hackathon for the state I also taught a Harvard computer science class called CS 50 in Rhode Island over 500 people applied we enrolled 150 and cs50 is rooted in the C programming language data structures algorithms computational thinking strong strong rigor and it was during that course in here the snapshot of it that's my head there I'll give you that same view but during that class I met one student that approached me halfway through everyone was two or three weeks behind in the except for one student who comes to me says I'm finished with the course I said you can't be that was cliff toward the end of the class Harvard had a global computer coding competition and cliffs team was only one of 13 that finished with a perfect score out of six hundred and thirtysomething teams worldwide perfect score I was impressed we began to hang out a little bit and cliff became my third geek crush that I had in my life the first was Jeff Rule from Fred's turkey house the second was Rapala s-- and then cliff so from there we formed career devs in career devs is the for-profit arm we're launching a computer science training academy this summer we're teaching people in Rhode Island New York and Boston rigorous computer science we were just in Brooklyn two weeks ago we're coming back again in May and there are 36 schools in the five boroughs that are interested in having career devs do work there same in Boston same in Rhode Island so we're expanding rapidly in addition in our the way that we're going to do computer science is different than the boot camps you don't call it a computer science boot camp because the students are really going to - often times when we see students graduating for boot camps they can't do anything significant when they complete the course so we want to make sure that there's a lot of testing and a lot of rigor in ideation at every stage we want to make sure this creation in portion that they can reiterate and from recall do examples that they create it's really really important plus we focus on data structures and algorithms which cliff is any Jedi Knight or would that be a fifth since we're on a dark side obvious is the other thing that's interesting is that I've had several entrepreneurial journeys over the years and a couple years ago I created a organization called crowd signed and I applied to one of the big incubators I thought wow they're going to love my idea and they rejected me I didn't have understanding of metrics total us total addressable market space I didn't there a lot there was a lot of things that I didn't understand so I had to hit the books one of my friend said oh go up to MIT that having this course on entrepreneurship so I went up there registered sat in on it learned a ton let go bill I'll let he has his great book you should check it out disciplined entrepreneurship so I internalized that and as I've done that several other people have come to me now saying they want some entrepreneurial help with their products the same way in the same way that I helped my friends learning about computer science I'm now helping people learn about entrepreneurship so cliff to myself we're going to be also teaching about entrepreneurship and as career devs launches to other companies that we're highlighting one is called calm and connect it allows you to connect with people as you would with LinkedIn professionally but socially based upon your location how many times are you traveling you're walking past someone on eighth or ninth or 16th that you could probably have a lot of synergy with but you don't know that person now become and connect in your pocket when you're passing that person you'll know in since you're in the same vicinity you'll be able to connect another one is called Kraus I'm informed analytics that helped drive the market for unsigned artist so it's data driven analytic driven innovative IP behind both of these companies that we're launching and clips the lead developer on both of those so what's our vision it's the same thing that happened with my friends but instead of people now we're also looking at corporations companies the difference being not just starting a business but what's a scalable innovation driven IP portfolio driven incubator look like that's designed for the under skilled and underserved because I've been convinced by Bill all let and people from Brown University like Dan wash a anyone can learn entrepreneurship and anyone can learn computer science if they apply themselves long enough if they hack at it long enough and so our goal is to create this multiplier this network multiplier that will really bring upon this error where we can reboot emerging domestic markets here in this country and so over time stay tuned in thank you [Applause] if you are interested in getting in contact with us or following our story you can follow along on intra-city geeks org career.com and you can email cliff myself as noted thanks once again so we're going to take a couple of questions if anyone has any questions they can feel free to ask them in or if you're interested in working for us and leaving Google yes and we have microphones over this we're gonna have each person stand up at a microphone to ask their questions throughout all of the struggles that you faced with two different you know cities moving back and forth what kept you so motivated to continue to go from the lower class to middle class and now being obviously very well being individual I don't know if I was a very wealthy individual but uh I took an uber here this morning never chauffeur but my motivation was you know interesting a so here's the interesting story from Cape Cod I remember once being out in the ocean with some of my friends and one of my friends said hey let's swim out to my father's boat it was that type of situation so we're swimming out to what we thought was his father's boat then he told us he was joking he goes this is my father's boat it's that one out there it's much further away and so in that situation there you just keep swimming because you have to swim and as I made it one mile or past one goal I just kept going and I kept swimming and and in one side like I said because when I made it to the middle class that's okay why did this now and even though it's hard work I'm gonna keep going because I looked like at a lot of my friends and family that were in Boston everyone's working hard whether you're a lower class middle class or upper class everyone has a pretty hard life in terms of our that you have to put in and everything's of that nature so I would rather work hard to bring about success and also try to bring people along with me so it's just you know I've never really thought about why so I answer your question I don't know but it's just something you don't give up you just can't give up and I know that I had my younger brother and sister that was a great motivating factor for me as well and then once they were set and friends and family that came along and yeah you always see needs and I guess you see needs and needs that need to be met and you go for it thank you any other questions yes all right thanks for sharing your story really appreciate it very nice ring thank you I talked about how to go with inner-city geeks is to help you help inner-city middle youth make the jump to middle class through the technology have you considered looking into other professions like law medicine finance and other professions for people who may not find them celebrate educator technology yes and I believe that will be the goal but like with most things when you're starting something you can only do one thing well right you can only do one thing well and for instance Google started off doing just a search engine and now you guys are doing a couple of things in addition to search all right and so yes but we do want to be to expand to bring more people into that because not everyone's gonna be a programmer or a network engineer yeah thank you thank you Hey so thank you for taking the time to share your story so what is success fit into city geeks and what do you guys want to accomplish over time so success for intra-city geeks and career devs is pretty pretty large I always have a question in this things it seems crazy when I hear it when I hear the goal in my head it sounds crazy but when you think of John F Kennedy standing up the saying in that New England accent we're gonna by the end of this decade we're going to put one man on the moon right or you look at the accomplishments of individuals and companies such as Google self-driving cars the work that's being done with tensorflow and machine learning and just all the advances that that's bringing out and bringing about my goal is to and it's been talked about so much but I really believe that in America we can set the example for having balanced income equality not everyone is going to be a Jeff Bezos or Larry Page or a Bill Gates but you don't you don't have to have large swathes of our society that living in squalor I believe that we can in the impact that people have that are underserved and under skilled they can contribute to the might of the American economic engine to make us an even stronger in greater country and that's not just for urban markets but that's also for suburban markets the principle from my high school since are now we need you to communicate because we have those pockets of under skilled people here and so it's not just an urban thing it's not a black thing or a Latino thing or a a white pink they're poor people everywhere in this country and that's my goal my goal is to create balance income equality well thanks once again I really appreciate the opportunity being here and we'll see you next time you ";
